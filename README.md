# cs310-k-ary-trees-message-encoding

Project Overview:
You will be making a k-ary tree class with certain required methods to support the encoding tree. You may choose to store
the tree internally using arrays or using a linked structure. Each has its advantages and disadvantages (specifically, arrays
will be quicker for Part 1 and linked structures will be more useful for Part 2 and the Extra Credit).

To give you some practice with trees structures generally, you will be asked to give basic information about the tree and
do some basic tree building (Part 1) and then perform some basic walks we’ve covered in class (Part 2). Once you have
the k-ary trees set up, you’ll be using the algorithm outlined in the previous section to walk through encoding trees and
decode messages (Part 3)! There are also some challenge problems related to the trees for extra credit (Part 4).
