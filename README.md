# cs310-k-ary-trees-message-encoding

Project Overview:
In this project I was required to make a k-ary tree class with certain required methods to support the encoding tree. I was
allowed to choose whether to store the tree internally using arrays or using a linked structure. I utilized a linked structure.
This gave me some practice with trees structures. I was am required to prompt the user to input the value of k for the tree and
do some basic tree building (Part 1) and then perform some basic walks weâ€™ve covered in class (Part 2). Once I had the k-ary trees
set up, the tree is used to walk through encoding trees and decode messages (Part 3)!
